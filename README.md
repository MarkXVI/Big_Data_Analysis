### Project Title: 
Analyzing NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data

#### Objective:
The objective of this project is to use Spark to analyze NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data, identify common themes and provide actionable insights.

#### Tools and Technologies: 
Apache Spark, Python, PySpark, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib

#### Data Source: 
Kaggle link [Click Here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data?select=yellow_tripdata_2016-03.csv)

### Steps:

- Data collection: NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data can be obtained from various sources, including the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission website, data.gov, and Kaggle. The data is typically provided in CSV format.
- Data preparation: The data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed before analysis. This involves removing missing or irrelevant data, formatting data types, and performing feature engineering.
- Data analysis: The data can be analyzed using various big data technologies, including Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink. Analysis techniques can include descriptive statistics, data visualization, clustering, classification, and regression.
- Extract insights: After analyzing the data, insights can be extracted, including patterns and trends, correlations, and relationships between variables. Insights can be presented using charts, graphs, and reports.
- Develop predictive models: Using machine learning techniques, predictive models can be developed to forecast future trends, such as demand for taxis or fare prices.
- Deploy the models: The models can be deployed to production, and real-time data can be fed to the models to make predictions.
- Monitor and optimize: The models need to be monitored for accuracy and optimized for better performance.

### Expected Outcomes:

#### Project Title: 
Analyzing User Reviews for Steam Games

#### Objective:
The objective of this project is to use Spark to analyze user reviews for Steam Games, identify common themes and sentiment, and provide actionable insights to create a well reviewed game.

#### Tools and Technologies: 
Apache Spark, Python, PySpark, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK

#### Data Source: 
Kaggle link [Click Here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021)


Steps:

- Load the dataset into a PySpark DataFrame.
- Clean and preprocess the text data using NLTK to remove stop words, punctuation, and perform stemming or lemmatization as needed.
- Use PySpark's machine learning libraries to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews, and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Use PySpark's Spark SQL to perform exploratory data analysis on the reviews, identify common themes, and extract insights such as the most frequently mentioned features, common complaints, and areas for improvement.
-Visualize the insights using Pandas and Matplotlib to create charts and graphs that can be easily understood by stakeholders.

#### Expected Outcomes:
