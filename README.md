# Big_Data_Analysis Project

### Project Title: 
Analyzing NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data

#### Objective:
The objective of this project is to use Spark to analyze NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data, identify common themes and provide actionable insights.

#### Tools and Technologies: 
Apache Spark, Python, PySpark, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Pandas

#### Data Source: 
Kaggle link [Click Here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data?select=yellow_tripdata_2016-03.csv)

### Steps:
- Data collection: NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data can be obtained from various sources, including the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission website, data.gov, and Kaggle. The data is typically provided in CSV format.
- Data preparation: The data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed before analysis. This involves removing missing or irrelevant data, formatting data types, and performing feature engineering.
- Data analysis: The data can be analyzed using various big data technologies, such as, Apache Spark. Analysis techniques can include descriptive statistics and data visualization.
- Extract insights: After analyzing the data, insights can be extracted, including patterns and trends, correlations, and relationships between variables. Insights can be presented using charts, graphs, and reports.

### Expected Outcomes: 
By the end of this project, you should have a better understanding of how to use Spark to analyze large datasets and extract actionable insights from the data. You should also have a better understanding of how to use PySpark to perform data analysis and visualization.
